Get start with the simple mcp client and server demo. Eventually, mcp/LLM allows us to build an Interactive Intelligent Programming Assistant that can be conveniently called within Jupyter code environments. It assists users in efficiently completing tasks such as intelligent data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and large model development. It can also customize knowledge bases and expand functionalities according to users' actual needs.

AI-Gen's basic functions are as follows:

ü§ñ Highly User-Friendly, Zero-Threshold Access: AI-Gen provides users with online large model application services. Without any hardware or network proxy requirements, it can be installed and launched with one click to start conversations.

üöÄ Powerful High-Precision RAG System: Synchronize local documents with one click and perform RAG retrieval and question answering. It supports searching through up to 1000 documents and 10GB of document content. It supports high-precision question answering for mainstream document formats such as md, ppt, word, and pdf. It can efficiently perform functions including summarizing massive documents, finding specific information within large datasets, and sentiment analysis question answering. AI-Gen can automatically identify whether RAG retrieval is needed based on the user's question.

üèÖ Local Python Code Interpreter: It can connect to the user's local Python environment to complete programming tasks, including writing code for data cleaning, data visualization, machine learning, deep learning, and large model development. It supports learning code libraries before programming, debugging based on the actual situation, and automatically uploading visualized images to image hosting services.

üö© High-Precision NL2SQL Function: It can write SQL according to user needs and automatically execute it by connecting to the local MySQL environment. It can automatically debug and supports retrieving data dictionaries and enterprise data knowledge bases before writing SQL, thereby improving SQL writing accuracy.

üõ©Ô∏è Visual and Network Capabilities: Enter an image URL during a conversation to enable AI-Gen's visual capability to recognize the content of the image. At the same time, AI-Gen also has network capabilities. When encountering questions it cannot answer, it can automatically turn on the search and answer mode.

üöÖ Unlimited Conversation Context: AI-Gen has unlimited conversation context length. AI-Gen will reasonably process historical conversation information density to achieve unlimited conversation context while saving tokens.

üí∞ Extremely Low Usage Cost: Although AI-Gen is driven by online large models, the actual usage cost is extremely low. In normal mode, 500,000 tokens only cost 1 yuan!

In addition, AI-Gen has high stability and high availability. It also supports Multi Function calling (opening multiple functions for one task) and Parallel Function calling (opening multiple executors for one function). It can automatically decompose complex tasks, automatically debug, and has a certain degree of "autonomy," capable of reviewing its own behavior and deeply understanding user intentions.
